# The Bingo Project
## What is it?
The Bingo Project is a British style bingo application created using Java.
The project is split into a client and a server system. The client is primarily used for rendering the incoming information from the server as well as making the server aware of the players existance.

The server is used for handling the game logic as well as handling the backend systems for authenticating and currency management.

## What are the future plans for The Bingo Project?
The Bingo Project has a range of plans for implementing new features as well as updating existing code. Due to time constraints these features are slowly being worked on, however the basic functionality is there.
### New Features
- American-style 5x5 bingo.
- Spring Admin panel for the Bingo Server.
- RESTful API for externally retrieving player data.
- End-to-End encryption.
### Updating Code
- Packet data sent using JSON format.
- Allowing connecting to multiple bingo games.

## How can I get a release?
Currently there are no public builds due to The Bingo Project still being in development. However, if you would like to try out a development build, you may clone this repository and compile the code yourself using whatever feels natural to you.
