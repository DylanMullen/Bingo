To complete before Login Window is completed:
	1. Create home tab
	2. Create register tab
	3. Give functionality to:
	- login
      	- Send data collected to the server
      	- Get a response and launch the main program
   	- register
      	- Send the register data to the server
      	- Get a response and make them login
      
Probably should do these:
	1. Make an actual UIButton class, instead of using JLabels directly
		- Benefits:
			- Much cleaner code
			- More control over custom features, eg: bg-colour
	2. Look into how to make gradient backgrounds
	3. Implement gradient backgrounds...
